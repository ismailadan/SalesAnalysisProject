# Sales analysis using Adventure Works Database

In this project, I analysed sales data against budget KPIs to see how sales were performing. I used MS SQL Server to write queries in order to
format and clean the data, storing the output in several CSVs. 

Finally, This was loaded into PowerBi, for further modelling, measure calculations and to create an interactive dashboard for the end user.
